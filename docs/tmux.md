tmux is a fantastic easy to use tool that is ideal to help manage this complex applicaiton. The project uses a simulated Kubernetes cluster.  Simulated deployments are launched to allocate fake resources. Additioanlly, simulated pods are launched.  Both deployment and pods are randomly created created and destroyed based on a schedule. So far that is two windows that need to runa process and an additional window for adminstration.
